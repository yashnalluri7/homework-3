        <h2>Introduction to Stock Market Investing</h2>
        <p>
            The stock market is one of the most powerful tools for wealth creation. It allows individuals and institutions 
            to invest in publicly traded companies by buying and selling shares. When you purchase a stock, you become a 
            part-owner of the company, and your investment’s value fluctuates based on market demand and company performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Investing in the stock market can be a great way to grow your money over time. There are two primary ways investors make money in the stock market:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Capital Appreciation:</strong> When a stock’s price increases, investors can sell it for a profit.</li>
            <li><strong>Dividends:</strong> Some companies distribute a portion of their earnings to shareholders as dividend payments.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Stock trading takes place on major stock exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq, where 
            thousands of transactions occur every second. Market movements are influenced by various factors, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Company earnings reports</strong> – Strong earnings often drive stock prices up.</li>
            <li><strong>Economic indicators</strong> – Factors like inflation, interest rates, and unemployment impact stock performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Investor sentiment</strong> – News, trends, and global events affect market confidence.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            While investing offers the potential for high returns, it also involves risks. Smart investors use 
            <strong>diversification</strong> (spreading investments across different industries and asset types) 
            to reduce exposure to losses. Many successful investors follow a long-term strategy, investing in index funds 
            that track the market’s overall growth, such as the S&P 500.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you're new to investing, it's important to start with research, patience, and a clear investment strategy. 
            By understanding key concepts and avoiding common pitfalls, you can make informed decisions and build a strong 
            financial future.
