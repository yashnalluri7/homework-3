        <h2>Understanding Stock Market Fundamentals</h2>
        <p>
            To be a successful investor, it‚Äôs important to understand some key concepts about how the stock market works. 
            The stock market is not just about buying and selling shares; it involves various factors that influence stock prices 
            and investment decisions.
        </p>

        <h3>1. What is a Stock?</h3>
        <p>
            A stock represents ownership in a company. When you buy a share of stock, you own a small portion of the company and may 
            have voting rights in major company decisions. Some companies also pay dividends, which are periodic payments to shareholders 
            as a share of the company‚Äôs profits.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Stock Exchanges & Market Movements</h3>
        <p>Stocks are traded on major exchanges such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)</strong> ‚Äì The largest and oldest stock exchange in the U.S.</li>
            <li><strong>Nasdaq</strong> ‚Äì A technology-focused exchange where many big tech companies like Apple and Microsoft are listed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The stock market follows cycles of ups and downs, often referred to as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bull Market üêÇ</strong> ‚Äì A period when stock prices are rising, and investor confidence is high.</li>
            <li><strong>Bear Market üêª</strong> ‚Äì A period when stock prices are falling, often due to economic uncertainty.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Types of Stocks</h3>
        <p>Stocks can be categorized into different types based on their risk, return, and company characteristics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Blue-Chip Stocks:</strong> Shares of large, well-established companies with a history of stability (e.g., Apple, Microsoft).</li>
            <li><strong>Growth Stocks:</strong> Companies expected to grow at a faster rate than the market, but often with higher risk (e.g., Tesla).</li>
            <li><strong>Dividend Stocks:</strong> Companies that pay regular dividends to shareholders (e.g., Coca-Cola).</li>
            <li><strong>Penny Stocks:</strong> Low-priced stocks with high risk and potential for large gains or losses.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. The Role of Index Funds & ETFs</h3>
        <p>
            Instead of picking individual stocks, many investors prefer Index Funds or ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) to spread risk:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Index Funds:</strong> These track a specific market index, like the S&P 500, which includes the 500 largest U.S. companies.</li>
            <li><strong>ETFs:</strong> Similar to index funds but trade like stocks, allowing for easier buying and selling.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            By investing in index funds or ETFs, beginners can benefit from diversification and lower risk compared to investing in individual stocks.
